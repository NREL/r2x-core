## Learning Path

These tutorials are designed to help you learn R2X Core from the ground up. They are learning-oriented and take you through building real, working examples.

### Getting Started

Start here if you're new to R2X Core:

- **[Getting Started with R2X Core](getting-started.md)** - Build your first power system model translator from scratch. Learn the core concepts by creating a complete working example.

### Working with Units

Once you understand the basics, learn how to handle physical units and per-unit normalization:

- **[Working with Units](working-with-units.md)** - Master the unit handling system by building components with automatic unit conversion, multiple display modes, and system-wide per-unit normalization.

## What's the Difference?

If you're wondering whether to use a tutorial or a how-to guide:

- **Tutorials** are for learning. They're step-by-step lessons that teach you concepts while building something concrete.
- **[How-To Guides](../how-tos/index.md)** are for doing. They're task-focused recipes that assume you already understand the basics.

Start with the tutorial above, then move to the how-to guides when you're ready to work on specific tasks.
