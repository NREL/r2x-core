# R2X Core Documentation

[![Docstring Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/docstring%20coverage-100%25-brightgreen.svg)](_static/docstr_coverage_badge.svg)

R2X Core is a model-agnostic framework for building power system model translators. It provides the core infrastructure, data models, plugin architecture, and APIs that enable translation between different power system modeling platforms.

## About R2X Core

R2X Core serves as the foundation for building translators between power system models like ReEDS, PLEXOS, SWITCH, Sienna, and more. It provides a plugin-based architecture where you can register parsers, exporters, and transformations to create custom translation workflows.

### Key Features

R2X Core offers the following capabilities:

- **Plugin-based architecture** - Singleton registry with automatic discovery and registration of plugins
- **Standardized component models** - Power system components via [infrasys](https://github.com/NREL/infrasys)
- **Multiple file format support** - Native support for CSV, HDF5, Parquet, JSON, and XML
- **Type-safe configuration** - Pydantic-based `PluginConfig` for model-specific parameters with defaults loading
- **Data transformation pipeline** - Built-in filters, column mapping, and reshaping operations
- **System modifiers** - Apply transformations to entire power system models with flexible context passing
- **Filter functions** - Register custom data processing functions for reusable transformations
- **Flexible data store** - Automatic format detection and intelligent caching
- **Entry point discovery** - External packages can register plugins via setuptools/pyproject.toml entry points

## Quick Start

```python
from r2x_core import PluginConfig, Plugin, PluginContext

# Define type-safe configuration
class MyModelConfig(PluginConfig):
    folder: str
    year: int

# Create a plugin
class MyModelPlugin(Plugin):
    def execute(self, context: PluginContext) -> None:
        # Plugin logic here
        pass

# Use it
config = MyModelConfig(folder="/path/to/data", year=2030)
plugin = MyModelPlugin(config)
```

👉 See {doc}`tutorials/getting-started` for a complete example.

### Plugin Discovery

Plugins can be registered programmatically or discovered from entry points. External packages register via `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.entry-points.r2x_plugin]
my_model = "my_package.plugins:my_plugin_component"
```

See {doc}`references/plugins` for detailed examples and {doc}`how-tos/register-plugins` for advanced patterns.
